# 100 Days of Code Round 2
 My learning progress


[1/100]
• Finally learned how to use Git and GitHub.
• Reviewed some HTML and CSS basics as part of the Treehouse Front End Web Development Techdegree that I started pursuing 2 days ago.
• I was very familiar with all of the concepts introduced in the curriculum thanks to the knowledge I gained during the first round of 100 Days of Code.
