# 100 Days of Code Round 2
 My learning progress


[1/100] <br>
• Finally learned how to use Git and GitHub. <br>
• Reviewed some HTML and CSS basics as part of the Treehouse Front End Web Development Techdegree that I started pursuing 2 days ago. <br>
• I was very familiar with all of the concepts introduced in the curriculum thanks to the knowledge I gained during the first round of 100 Days of Code.

[2/100] <br>
• Finished all the courses about HTML and CSS basics in Unit 1 and getting ready to start working on the first project. <br>
• Although I've started learning about HTML and CSS approximately 3 months ago, there were things that I haven't come across in the past. For example, today I've learned about <code>aside</code> and <code>pre</code> tags, root-relative paths which only work when a website is uploaded to a web server or when you have a local web server running on your computer, as well as about HTML entities and reserved characters. <br>
• Installed a couple more useful VS Code extensions such as Bracket Pair Colorizer and jshint, and learned some new shortcuts, such as Shift+Tab (allows you to tab an entire code block backwards/forwards), !+Tab (to add HTML boilerplate) and Cmd+Shift+L (selects all occurrences). Learning about Emmet Abbreviation was very helpful too. <br>
• Besides that, I've also started to learn how to create website prototypes in Adobe XD.

[3/100] <br>
• Haven't learned anything new today but got a lot of coding done because I've started working on the first project of the Techdegree I'm enrolled in (an online coding bootcamp by Treehouse).<br>

[4/100] <br>
• Finished and submitted project of Unit 1 (personal profile page) and started Unit 2 which will eventually lead to project 2 (build a responsive, mobile-first layout using HTML and CSS).<br>
• The sections I've completed today were about CSS basics, such as linking and importing style sheets, ID and class selectors, and pseudo-classes. All of these topics were covered in the Responsive Web Design course I took on freeCodeCamp but it's always nice to review some of these foundations.<br>
• I also went on with Adobe XD (today I wasn't following a course thoug, just experimenting on my own).
