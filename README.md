# 100 Days of Code Round 2
 My learning progress


[1/100] <br>
• Finally learned how to use Git and GitHub. <br>
• Reviewed some HTML and CSS basics as part of the Treehouse Front End Web Development Techdegree that I started pursuing 2 days ago. <br>
• I was very familiar with all of the concepts introduced in the curriculum thanks to the knowledge I gained during the first round of 100 Days of Code.

[2/100] <br>
• Finished all the courses about HTML and CSS basics in Unit 1 and getting ready to start working on the first project. <br>
• Although I've started learning about HTML and CSS approximately 3 months ago, there were things that I haven't come across in the past. For example, today I've learned about <code>aside</code> and <code>pre</code> tags, root-relative paths which only work when a website is uploaded to a web server or when you have a local web server running on your computer, as well as about HTML entities and reserved characters. <br>
• Installed a couple more useful VS Code extensions such as Bracket Pair Colorizer and jshint, and learned some new shortcuts, such as Shift+Tab (allows you to tab an entire code block backwards/forwards), !+Tab (to add HTML boilerplate) and Cmd+Shift+L (selects all occurrences). Learning about Emmet Abbreviation was very helpful too. <br>
• Besides that, I've also started to learn how to create website prototypes in Adobe XD.

[3/100] <br>
• Haven't learned anything new today but got a lot of coding done because I've started working on the first project of the Techdegree I'm enrolled in (an online coding bootcamp by Treehouse).<br>

[4/100] <br>
• Finished and submitted project of Unit 1 (personal profile page) and started Unit 2 which will eventually lead to project 2 (build a responsive, mobile-first layout using HTML and CSS).<br>
• The sections I've completed today were about CSS basics, such as linking and importing style sheets, ID and class selectors, and pseudo-classes. All of these topics were covered in the Responsive Web Design course I took on freeCodeCamp but it's always nice to review some of these foundations.<br>
• I also went on with Adobe XD (today I wasn't following a course thoug, just experimenting on my own).

[5/100] <br>
• Another day full of reviewing basic CSS concepts, such as selectors, values and units.
• Started another section of the curriculum which is about the box model.
• I've been practicing what I've learned by building a simple landing page.

[6/100] <br>
• Went on with basic CSS today (the course is more than 6 hours long) and reviewed everything about the box model, background properties and floats.<br>
• I am really glad I didn't skip any of the videos because I almost forgot how useful <code>box-sizing: border box;</code> or <code>max-width: 100%;</code>are!<br>
• Also kept working on building the landing page. I have changed some styles and added images to the page. When I was trying to style one of the links, I just couldn't make the styles apply, and only after quite a long time, full of much frustration, I noticed that instead of assigning a class to the link I needed to style, I assigned an id selector. What a silly mistake! Glad I figured it out though.

[7/100] <br>
• Box shadows, text shadows and gradients today. When I learned about gradients a couple months ago, I didn't dive too deep into the topic, so I learned some pretty cool stuff today, especially how to layer multiple background images. <br>
• I also continued learning how to make website mockups and created my first mockup (only a phone version for now).

[8/100] <br>
• Today I applied media queries to the landing page I've been working on to make it responsive. <br>
• Besides that, I was learning about the importance, specificity and source order in CSS.

[9/100] <br>
• Learned how to use normalize.css to do a CSS reset, and how to create a fill-width header and sticky footer.
• Started using a mobile first layout approach which I wasn't doing in the past! 
• I was also reviewing and practicing display properties.

[10/100] <br>
• Started the section about CSS floats today and adjusted the layout of the practice page I've been building using floats.

[11/100] <br>
• Kept on working with CSS floats to make sure I understand how to use them together with the "clearfix" hack. Since I used to use mostly flexbox and grid, I still don't entirely understand some aspects of floats, so I'm planning to do some further reading tomorrow.

[12/100] <br>
• Started working on the second project (2/9) for the Treehouse techdegree, so I've spend most of the day creating a mobile-first responsive layout based on the given mockups. I'm almost done with the mobile version, tomorrow I'm going to create media queries for tablets and desktops and hopefully finish the project.
