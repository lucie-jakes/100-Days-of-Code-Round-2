# 100 Days of Code Round 2
 My learning progress


[1/100] <br>
• Finally learned how to use Git and GitHub. <br>
• Reviewed some HTML and CSS basics as part of the Treehouse Front End Web Development Techdegree that I started pursuing 2 days ago. <br>
• I was very familiar with all of the concepts introduced in the curriculum thanks to the knowledge I gained during the first round of 100 Days of Code.

[2/100] <br>
• Finished all the courses about HTML and CSS basics in Unit 1 and getting ready to start working on the first project. <br>
• Although I've started learning about HTML and CSS approximately 3 months ago, there were things that I haven't come across in the past. For example, today I've learned about <code>aside</code> and <code>pre</code> tags, root-relative paths which only work when a website is uploaded to a web server or when you have a local web server running on your computer, as well as about HTML entities and reserved characters. <br>
• Installed a couple more useful VS Code extensions such as Bracket Pair Colorizer and jshint, and learned some new shortcuts, such as Shift+Tab (allows you to tab an entire code block backwards/forwards), !+Tab (to add HTML boilerplate) and Cmd+Shift+L (selects all occurrences). Learning about Emmet Abbreviation was very helpful too. <br>
• Besides that, I've also started to learn how to create website prototypes in Adobe XD.

[3/100] <br>
• Haven't learned anything new today but got a lot of coding done because I've started working on the first project of the Techdegree I'm enrolled in (an online coding bootcamp by Treehouse).<br>

[4/100] <br>
• Finished and submitted project of Unit 1 (personal profile page) and started Unit 2 which will eventually lead to project 2 (build a responsive, mobile-first layout using HTML and CSS).<br>
• The sections I've completed today were about CSS basics, such as linking and importing style sheets, ID and class selectors, and pseudo-classes. All of these topics were covered in the Responsive Web Design course I took on freeCodeCamp but it's always nice to review some of these foundations.<br>
• I also went on with Adobe XD (today I wasn't following a course thoug, just experimenting on my own).

[5/100] <br>
• Another day full of reviewing basic CSS concepts, such as selectors, values and units.
• Started another section of the curriculum which is about the box model.
• I've been practicing what I've learned by building a simple landing page.

[6/100] <br>
• Went on with basic CSS today (the course is more than 6 hours long) and reviewed everything about the box model, background properties and floats.<br>
• I am really glad I didn't skip any of the videos because I almost forgot how useful <code>box-sizing: border box;</code> or <code>max-width: 100%;</code>are!<br>
• Also kept working on building the landing page. I have changed some styles and added images to the page. When I was trying to style one of the links, I just couldn't make the styles apply, and only after quite a long time, full of much frustration, I noticed that instead of assigning a class to the link I needed to style, I assigned an id selector. What a silly mistake! Glad I figured it out though.

[7/100] <br>
• Box shadows, text shadows and gradients today. When I learned about gradients a couple months ago, I didn't dive too deep into the topic, so I learned some pretty cool stuff today, especially how to layer multiple background images. <br>
• I also continued learning how to make website mockups and created my first mockup (only a phone version for now).

[8/100] <br>
• Today I applied media queries to the landing page I've been working on to make it responsive. <br>
• Besides that, I was learning about the importance, specificity and source order in CSS.
